This script basically downloads an image from the internet, makes that image the wallpaper then goes ahead to open notepad,
writes a message, closses notepad and pop's a message box saying DEMO HAS ENDED 'something of the like'


This is my first script written it myself to learn mainly ducky script basics. 
More to come!!
